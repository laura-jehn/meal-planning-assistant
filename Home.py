Are you also fed up with constantly figuring out what to eat every day, only to realize your partner isn't in the mood for it, or worse — you’re missing half the ingredients?

I definitely am. And with full-time work starting soon, who even has time to plan, shop, and cook every day?

That’s exactly why I built this simple tool to:

- 🗓️ Plan 5 meals a week, ahead of time

- 🛒 Generate one combined grocery list, so you only shop once

- ⭐ Get feedback from your partner, with stars and comments

- 🧠 Save mental energy, and avoid the daily "what do we eat?" dilemma

If you’re also trying to save time and reduce stress around meals, this might be for you too.
